You can find the API documentation at: https://www.feedzai.com/developers/rest-api/. There is an unofficial Java SDK to interface with our service that you can use to get started quickly (https://github.com/killbill/feedzai-client). Note that this SDK was not built by Feedzai but by another one of the hackathon teams, which gave us authorization to share it with you.

For the Money20/20 Hackathon we also provide some mock (but realistic) data to get you started with. Let me know if you have any questions or if there is any way we can help you set up.
